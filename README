%{scl_prefix}-ruby-wrapper

This is just a tiny wrapper script to be used as a shim where useful. It is
used in OpenShift Origin for RHEL+RHSCL installs and it's been packaged 
independently in hopes it might be useful for others.

You should find an example script in your docdir (most likely
/usr/share/doc/%{scl_prefix}-ruby-wrapper/)
